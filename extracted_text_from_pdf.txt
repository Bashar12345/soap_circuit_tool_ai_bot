required by MARAD

The attached deck plate guide is issued for performance of RRF

The purpose of this guide is to provide direction for effective, efficient, and safe performance of
MARAD shipboard logistics support, and to standardize procedures used in accomplishing
applicable tasks. The contract and this guide are to be followed by all ProLog and subcontractor
employees who provide logistics services to MARAD. Where the term ProLog is used it is
intended to include subcontractors to the above contract as well as ProLog. This guide is not
intended to restrict the effectiveness of the individuals involved, but to provide a foundation for
effective, consistent and complete consideration of all aspects of the task. The expected result is
a positive, professional relationship between MARA D, ProLog, subcontractors, and RRF ship
managers leading to completion of a successful overhaul.

The contract Statement of Work (SOW) takes precedence over this guide. Numbers in
parentheses refer to paragraphs of the SOW. ProLog and subcontractor Supervisors and Team
Leaders are to use this guide and the contract SOW to train and to evaluate employees for their
work. |

If there are any questions or concerns relative to the guide, or the ability of the employee to
respond effectively to the requirements, it is the responsibility of each employee to bring such
matters to my attention or their supervisor’s immediately. |

This guide will be refined and revised over time as more experience is gained in the use of the
NS5 system, and program enhancements are released. I encourage and expect questions and
feedback from all employees to improve the quality and safety of our work, as well as to reduce
the costs incurred.

This guide is to be followed at all times unless written exceptions are made by the Program
Manager. :

I. Purpose. To establish standard policies and procedures governing the logistics overhaul
and upgrades process for the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARA D)
under contract number DTMA91C20110011.

aadiereo Ie Ogisti tics overhauls or upgrades. MARAD will also determine the scope of the overhaul
or the upgrade. The schedule will be cognizant of ship activations, operational requirements, and
other shipboard logistics work being carried out on RRF ships. The following issues and
requirements provide a template for the logistics overhaul and upgrade process.

(a)

Overhaul budget plan. ProLog will provide to MARAD by 15" July each year a
logistics overhaul budget plan for the next fiscal year (C.2.2.2).

ARAD a cost estimate of a
1encement of the upgrade

(b) Overhaul cost estimate. ProLog will provide to M.
scheduled upgrade or overhaul 60 days prior to the comn
or overhaul (C.2.2).

Pre-overhaul brief. Prior to te start of the overhaul, ProLog will attend a pre-
overhaul brief hosted by MAR During this briefing, MAR-614, ProLog,
Ship Manager, and MARAD division representatives will discuss issues and
concerns pertinent to the logistics overhaul, including scope of work and issues
that will impact the overhaul. The plan for concurrent storeroom alterations and
parts/documentation cabinet installations is to be coordinated. Potential cost
savings measures are to be identified. An outline of the ProLog briefing to be
used at this meeting is provided at Appendix A. At this meeting, MARAD will
provide ProLog with Special Overhaul Instructions (C.2.1.2).

(c)

(d) Special Overhaul Instructions. Generated by MARAD Headquarters and the
Region Logistics Management Officer (LMO), the Special Overhaul Instructions
will:

- describe the general location of spare parts to be included in the overhaul
or upgrade,

- provide guidance on collocating similar or related spare parts, and

- identify equipment or systems that will be installed, changed out or
removed by the Ship Manager during the period of the overhaul (C.2.1.3).

(e) Tasking Order. ProLog accepts the final Tasking Order.

(f) Safety Briefing. Conduct Shipboard/Shore-based personnel and equipment
safety briefing prior to start of overhauls or upgrades and comply with the RRF
Logistics Management Manual. Ship Manager participation will be requested for
this safety briefing. Further safety information is detailed in the ProLog Standard
Operating Procedures for Safety (SOP 0).

Setting up NSS Access Aboard

he Ship

2. The overhaul team will need access to the ship’s NS5 to complete data entry. The team

will need to confirm the NS5 network setup onboard the ship.

e NS5 network will be in either

a SeaWave or non-SeaWave configuration. Procedures for both configurations follow.

(a)

(b)

SeaWave. Coordinate with the Chief Engineer to set up a designated space that
the Overhaul Team will use when networking their laptops to the vessel’s
SeaWave system/NS5 server. Once a space has been assigned, conduct a test of
the connectivity for the assigned drop to NS5 by attaching the teams Cat 5 cable
to the NS5 drop and attempt to access NSS. If you cannot access the vessel’s
server, contact the Chief Engineer and check the NS5 hub and router Cat 5 cable
connections. It is possible that the NS5 drop that has not been connected to the
hub or router due to the assigned working space not being in use by the ship.

Non-SeaWave. On some | vessels, there is a stand-alone NS5 server that is
still being used pending SeaWave installation. Coordinate with the Chief
Engineer to set up a designated space that the Overhaul Team will use when
networking their laptop to the vessel’s NS5 server. Our laptops are not set up to
operate with non-Sea-Wave stand-alone systems. In order for the team to
network their laptops with the non-SeaWave system, they must contact
management who will set up a phone conference with the MARAD NS5 System
Administrator to walk them through set-up of the laptops to function with the
non-SeaWave server.

In some cases other alternatives may be needed, in which cases special procedures will be
provided.

.\NUAL INVENTORY (C.2.5.3)

Preparation

l. To prepare for a full inventory of the technical manuals aboard the ship, the following
actions are to be undertaken.

(a) Inventory aids are provided by the Logistics Support Manager upon request of the
Team Leader. Normally give two weeks notice to get the aids. A sample
inventory aid appears in Appendix B as Form 2.

(b) Search ship for, assemble, and organize manuals in a designated location for
inventory.

(c) For technical manual accountability, a sign-in/out log will be maintained by the
contractor. All technical manuals needed by the inventory team or ship’s crew
must be documented within this log. A sample of this log is available in
Appendix B as Form 5.

Procedures

(a) Conduct inventory. Technical manuals are sorted in alphabetical order by
manufacturer, then within each manufacturer alphabetically by the title. The
manuals should now be i in the same order as the inventory aids that were created.

(b) Consult with the Chief Engineer (CE) and take out as many excess manuals as
possible, segregating them for later. The logistics analyst will then ensure that all
information on the inventory aids is correct and matches the technical manuals on
hand. Having all manuals in one central location also gives the logistics analyst a
chance to compare the technical manuals, and make sure they are identical in
content and complete. Handwritten information must comply with Appendix C-1.

(c) Once this is complete, new index numbers are assigned.

ALIDATION (C.2.5.1)

l. Accurate ship equipment configuration records are the foundation for proper spare parts
support, maintenance plans, and technical documentation. It is essential that the equipment data
in NS5 be complete and accurate. Equipment validation is the process of establishing or updating
the ship equipment configuration in NSS.

Preparation

2. To prepare for a full equipment validation aboard the ship, the following actions are
required:

(a) Validation aids are provided by the Logistics Support Manager upon request of
the Team Leader. Normally give two weeks notice to get the aids. A sample
validation aid appears in Appendix B as Form 7.

(b) Validation aids are printed in the same order that they appear in the ship’s NS5
equipment hierarchy.

(c) Review the current Non Validation Worthy (NVW) list and other MARAD
directed amendments to this list. Equipment listed as NVW does not have to > be
validated.

(d) Review the current equipment hierarchy guidance. Since NS5 includes planned
maintenance functionality it is critical that the hierarchy be in conformance with
the guidance. Also there may be a need to validate some equipment which in the
past was not validated. If the ship plans to link standard jobs to equipment it needs
to be in NSS. In some cases dummy equipment records are needed to provide a
place to attach parts or maintenance for equipment groups. Wh
Team Leader is to consult with the Logistics Support Manager.

Procedures

3. The following procedures are to be followed for equipment validation:

(a) Validation aids for some equipment can be removed from the package as they are
for subsystems or dummy categories

(b) The validation sheets are grouped by major equipments and their associated
equipments. These groups are assigned a validation package number, created

18

from the validation aid page number of the major equipment being validated.
Page numbers of associated equipments are lined out and the major equipment
number with “a”, “b”, “c”, etc. is written in its place. This ties the equipments
together into a validation package. A cover sheet (Form 8 in Appendix B) is
prepared and attached to the package to track package progress. The package
number is documented on the Equipment Validation Tracking Report (Form 9 in
Appendix B). | a

(c) Recording nameplate information: For safety and accuracy two-person teams
will validate equipment nameplate data. One team member will read off the
nameplate data while the other member fills in or verifies the data against the
validation aid and marks it up with edits and additions. Next, the recorder will
read back his recorded information to confirm it is correct. All numbers, letters
and abbreviations will be in accordance with ProLog current approved standards.
Samples of these are located in Appendix C. Lastly, the team will stick a brightly
colored dot on the equipment to indicate that it has been validated; the dot will

contain the last five (5) numbers of the Equipment Record ID.

(d) Recording technical manual information: Check the nameplate information and
ensure a match with the technical manual identified for the equipment. If there is
a mismatch, the TM may not be the correct one for the equipment. If the TM
matches, record any additional information called for on the validation aid

including TM Index Number.

(e) Validator’s should sign and date the completed validation aid.

Equipment Data Entry

Caution DO NOT reuse/recycle records, the possible adverse effects of this practice is
unknown.

A, Data obtained from the equipment nameplate and technical manual should be recorded in

6

NS5 as follows. Nameplate info takes precedence.

Data in Top Part of Equipment Record

undertaken.

(a) Inventory aids are provided by the Logistics Support Manager upon request of the
Team Leader. Normally give two weeks notice to get the aids. A sample inventory aid
appears in Appendix B as Form 10.

(b) The parts will be sorted by location and then alphabetically by part name prior to
printing them out on blue-colored paper. A blank inventory aid printed on white paper
must also be printed and will be used as an add sheet.

(c) Inventory Aid sheets are grouped into inventory packages according to their location
and identified by the location name. A cover sheet (Form 11 in Appendix B) is
prepared and attached to the package to track package progress; the package number

Procedures

2. The following is a summary of the spare parts inventory procedures

3. The Team Leader will assign each team member an inventory package. The logistics
analyst will start by locating the appropriate technical references to use while conducting the
inventory. The logistics analyst will verify the part against the technical reference and record the
I'M reference information on the Inventory sheet. The logistics analyst will also verify all data
on the inventory aid including on hand quantity. Corrections will be noted on the inventory aid.

RE Se

All numbers, letters and abbreviations will be in accordance with currently
approved standards. These standards are located in Appendices C and D. If there is any doubt
whether the material should be inventoried, consult with the Team Leader. The final

, ProLog is to prepare and submit as required the following reports to

-614 for all

logistics overhauls.

a

Gantt chart. A Gantt chart is to be submitted by the 15 of each month that is

produced in MSPROJECT, for each vessel undergoing a logistics overhaul
(C.2.4.3). |

eekly logistics overhaul report. This report is prepared weekly to track
overhaul progress but does not contain cost data which is reported monthly. It is
submitted to MAR-614 each Monday for activity during the previous week.
Submission is to occur on Tuesday if the Monday is a public holiday (C.2.4.4).

See Appendix B, Form 3 for an example. Team Leaders are to be aware of the
following when compiling the report.

D may suspend, modify or scale back an ongoing overhaul at any time. When

directed to suspend an ongoing overhaul, the Overhaul Team must:

a

Return all spare parts, drawings and technical manuals to a location recorded in
the NSS database.

i

Depart the vessel within 96 hours (C.2.5.7.1), or when directed by
Ship Manager

I. Team Leaders and data entry team members are required to use the current M ARAD
shipboard logistics program (NS5) and must be trained properly in this system. All team

members are trained in the specific work and safety procedures related to their task, including the
provisions of this document. Each team member is to be given, read, and retain a copy of these
procedures. The Team Leader will normally provide the required training on the job, but if more
extensive training is advisable, the Team Leader will recommend such training to management

or in turn my request formal training support from MARAD.
Working Hours (C2.5.7.3)
2. The working hours of the shipboard logistics team must not significantly interfere with

the day-to-day work of the ship's crew. To avoid conflicts between the schedule of the ship and
the overhaul team, the Team Leader will obtain approval from the region LMO before working
on any MARAD vessel during the following periods:

(a) before 8:00 AM or after 5:00 PM on weekdays,
(b) on Saturdays and Sundays,

(c) during any Federal holiday, and

(d) any day between December 21 and 5 January.

3. The ProLog Program Manager will obtain approval from MAR-614 before working

during any of the following periods:

(a) any day a vessel is underway,

(b) any day of, or the day before, a vessel's departure,

(c) any day of, or the day the immediately after a ship has returned from activation,

(d) any hours that will result in a member of the ship's crew having to work overtime
outside of 8:00 AM or 5:00 PM, on weekends or on holidays (C.2.5.7.3).

If overtime is required to complete a job then the Program Manager will seek approval
MARAD before work can be started.

Operating Ship Equipment

5. Overhaul Team Members are not permitted to operate or open installed machinery or
material handling equipment aboard ship. In special situations, consult with the ProLog Logistics
Support Manager and the ship’s crew. See the Safety Section of this SOP for further safety
information.

4]

Authority of and Communication with the Ship Manager

6. While aboard any RRF ship, the overhaul team must comply with all safety and security
orders, instructions and directives issued by the ship's Port Engineer, Master, Chief Engineer or
their representatives in the exercise of their legal authority. (C.2.5.7.8). Normal overhaul
Processes | require that the t team leader ¢ communicate regularly with the Chief Engineer and

Cleanliness

7. All team working spaces will be kept clean and uncluttered. Trash generated by the team
will be removed from the ship daily. Upon final departure the spaces used by the team should be
cleaner and more shipshape than when the team arrived.

Identification

8. All employees are required to obtain a Transportation Workers Identification Credential
(TWIC) card. Employees must display a security badge at all times aboard ship. This
requirement may be satisfied a company issued badge, MARAD badge, or a TWIC card.

3. ProLog overhaul team members are to comply with all applicable safety regulations,
however as their work place is located at MARAD work places such as ships or warehouses,
they are also to comply with the relevant MARAD regional warehouse safety plan, and also with

any Ship Manager safety policies.

A, When commencing a ship logistics overhaul the Team Leader is to arrange for the team
to receive a comprehensive safety briefing from the Ship Manager. Further safety briefings from
the Ship Manager should be requested at regular intervals during the ship logistics overhaul to
reinforce safety knowledge and awareness. If the Team Leader is not able to arrange for these
briefing he should inform the ProLog Logistics Support Manager who will take necessary action.

5. The shipboard working environment requires extra caution be taken. Below are some of
the most important requirements. |

a. Wear authorized steel toe shoes, and a hard hat as required by local working
conditions.

b. Always have a working flashlight on your person.

c. Memorize the escape route for the space in which you are working.
d. Watch for open deck hatches and scuttles, and missing deck plates.
e. Be careful with cutting devices

f. Get help moving boxes and use good lifting techniques.

g. Be aware of foul air; report such conditions to your Supervisor.

h. Think before you take any action.

DETAILED TECHN

lL. Technical Manuals. A ships set of technical manuals provides information for the operations and
maintenance of installed equipment and related systems, and the operational procedures and policy guidance
for operation of the ship. The ships set of technical manual are inventoried as part of a ships logistics
overall, logistics upgrade, or as a separate task. Their inventory should be completed prior to equipment

validation and spare part inventory.

2. Technical Manual Inventory. All technical manuals on board the ship will be assembled in one
location and maintained as a set for the original storage location. Individual technical manuals located
throughout the ship will be incorporated into these original sets.

a. Accountability. Once the ships technical manuals are assembled by the Logistics Contractor,
the contractor is responsible for their accountability until the inventory has been accepted by the MARAD
COTR.

(1) The contractor must maintain a sign out/in log for the technical manuals for use by
validation and inventory personnel, or ships crew to maintain this accountability. The effort must be
coordinated with the CE, to provide access to the technical manuals during established work hours for using
personnel.

(2) The format for the sign out/in.log sheet is provided at Appendix B Form S.

(3) If copying of the technical manuals is required, their removal from the ship must be
approved by the Chief Engineer to ensure technical manuals are available for current/planned
work.

b. Inventory Procedures

(1) The technical manuals in each set will be sorted in alphabetical sequence; by
manufacturers, then within each manufacturer, alphabetical by the technical manual title. If the
Chief Engineer does not want the ships technical manuals arranged into this standard MARAD
sort, the MARAD Logistics Specialist must be notified. MARAD (MAR -614) will make the
final decision. |

(2) A white temporary label will be placed on each technical manual cover to number the
technical manuals after sorting. The label will not be placed over any printed information.

(3) The numbering will start with the Chief Engineers set, which is considered the master set.
The technical manuals will be numbered in sequence starting with number 1. Technical manuals
with the same manufacturer and title in all sets and additional copies, will have the same number.

This number is identified in the database as the MARAD number.

(4) When several technical manuals are consolidated into a binder, the binder and all
included technical manuals will have the same number.

(5) If the technical manuals are currently numbered, an index of the technical manuals with
the original number will be used to provide a cross reference from the old number to the new
number. The index is maintained to assist in equipment validation, and spare part identification.

20
The cross-reference will be retained until the MARAD COTR accepts the technical manual
inventory. :

(6) An inventory aid produced from the ships existing technical manual data base or NS5
will be used to inventory the technical manuals from each location. During inventory, the index
will be marked up to indicate current technical manual information. All technical manuals not
on the index will be written up using the technical manual inventory add sheet. The marked up
inventory aid and technical manual add sheets will be used for data entry to update NSS.

(7) In these cases where no technical manual data base exists. the technical manuals will he

sorted as identified in paragraph 2b (1) above. The technical manuals will be written up using
the technical manuals add sheets. The add sheets will be used for data entry to updated NSS.

(8) During inventory of technical manuals, the manufacturer’s number for the technical
manual must be recorded. The manufacturer technical manual number will be placed in the full

description field. Record MFR TM NO: (then the number).

(10) Bar coded labels are printed for each technical manual. The bar coded label will be
covered with clear plastic tape to protect the label. The bar coded label will not cover any
printed information on the technical manual cover. If the ship’s NSS is used to print the standard
size bar code label, a small sticker should also be applied with the MARAD number and location
on it.

(11) During the inventory, technical manuals which no longer apply to an on board
equipment, are removed from the inventory, labeled as excess.

(12) Prior to the technical manual inventory, the CE may provide a list of removed equipment
to assist in the removal of EXCESS technical manuals, by if not then the team leader will need to
consult with the CE

(13) If the information for a removed equipment is in a consolidated equipment technical
manual, the information will not be removed from the consolidated technical manual.

(14) The removal of EXCESS technical manuals is an ongoing process until the inventory is
accepted by the MARAD COTR.

3. Technical Manual Inventory Add Sheet. The following information is provided to assist
inventory personnel to correctly fill out the technical manual inventory add sheet.

(1) LOCATION and QTY: Record the quantity of each Technical Manual in the space
provided next to its storage location.

(2) COND UNSAT: Record the total number of Technical Manuals that are in
unsatisfactory condition in each storage location. A separate record must be added for each
technical manual which is in unsatisfactory condition and the Chief Engineer wants it keep in the
inventory.

(3) TITLE: Record the title of the Technical Manual starting with the Equipment name
followed by the full title and the type of the Technical Manual, if it is specialized. Specialized
Technical Manuals are an Installation Manual, Operating Manual, Maintenance Manual or Part
Manual. 7

21
(4) MER TM NO: Record the equipment manufacturer’s technical manual number. If the
number is longer than 15 characters, place the number in the title field after the title. Record —
MER TM NO :(then the number).

ml [anual
but not stated in the TITLE. Such data may be the model number, drawing numbers, or a list of
applications that the Technical Manual may apply. If the Technical Manual covers several
types or models of equipment, each should be recorded in this field This is often found in galley
equipment. If there appears to be more information that can be listed in this field, include the

(5) EQUIPMENT COVERED: Record the equipment covered in the Technical M

most important _equipment/data.

(6) IAN RER: This will always be the Manufacturer of the equipment, not the
writer and/or publisher of the Technical Manual. It must always be completed.

(7) INVENTORIED BY/DATE: The individual who completes the technical manual
inventory add sheet will enter their initials and the current date.
A. Deletions or additions to the technical manual inventory.
a. Technical manuals should be removed from the inventory as equipment is removed from the

ARAD index

ship. The remaining technical manuals will not be renumbered because the current M
number is listed in the equipment and spare part records.

b. Technical manuals may be added to the inventory for newly installed equipment, according
to the equipment manufacturers name and technical manual title.

(1) The new technical manual will fall into Sequence between two numbered technical
manuals. Alphabetical characters are used to insert the technical manual into the inventory.

(2) The following example applies.

(a) Current Technical Manual #002, manufacturer ABC, Title: Pump centrifugal:
current Technical Manual #3 manufacturer ABC, Title: Pump, rotary.

(b) New technical manual: Manufacturer A] iC, title: Pump, gear.

(c) The new technical manual is added to the existing list as Technical Manual
#O02A. Its title: Pump, gear is in sequence between the Technical Manual #2 title, and
Technical Manual #003 title.

(d) This same process is used when there are greater difference between the MARAD
numbers which the new Technical Manuals number falls into sequence.

5. Technical Manual Copying. Two complete sets of the ships technical manual will be left onboard
the ship and details entered into NSS, at the completion of the inventory.

a. Removal of technical manuals from the ship for copying must be approved by, and
coordinated with the CE.

b. The technical manuals will be removed for copying from the master set in increments of the
quantity approved by the CE.

22
C. The copied technical manual must be checked page by page with the original technical
manual to provide a complete and usable copy.

d. The copy will be numbered the same as the original technical manual.
e. The copied technical manual will be bar code labeled without covering any printed

information on the technical manual cover. The bar coded label will be covered with clear plastic
tape to protect it.

23
RAWING INVENTORY PROCEDURES

lL. Drawings. A ships set of drawings provides details of how the ship was built, altered or modified.
They contain various types of drawings, plans, information booklets and certifications data sheets. The ships
set of drawings are inventoried as part of a ships logistics overhaul, logistics upgrade, or as a separate task.
Their inventory should be completed prior to equipment validation and spare part inventory. If the drawings are
stored in hanging file folders, the file folder will be labeled with the drawing number using a small mini-label.

2. Drawings Inventory. All drawings on board the ship will be assembled in one location and maintained
as a set, unless the MARAD directs their storage in a different location. Sometimes, drawings for a
modification or alteration of the ship to meet a special operational requirement are stored separately from the
ships drawings. Individual drawings located throughout the ship will be incorporated into the original set.

a. Accountability. Once the ships drawings are assembled by the Logistics Contractor, the
contractor is responsible for their accountability until the inventory has been accepted by the MARAD

COTR.

(1) The contractor must maintain a sign out/in log for the drawings for use by validation and
inventory personnel, or ships crew to maintain this accountability. The effort must be
coordinated with the CE, to provide access to the drawings during established work hours for
using personnel.

(2). The format for the sign out/in log sheet is provided as Appendix B Form 5.

b. Sorting. The drawings are sorted by shipbuilder then by vendor di awings. The vendors are then
sorted alphabetically. If a ship has conversion overhaul drawings, treat them as another shipbuilder and
file them accordingly. Sort the drawings by a vendor group according to their drawing number. The
drawings should now be in the same order as the drawing inventory aids that were created.

(1) DO NOT un-staple any drawings; often associated drawings, booklets and certification
data sheets are fastened together. These will be sorted by the manufacturer and drawing number
of the main drawings. |

(2) Do not remove any drawing from its folder or envelope, they will be sorted in numeric
order of the main drawing unless otherwise directed by the MARAD Representative.

(3) If there is no manufacturer’s drawing number on a drawing, that drawing will go in the
front of that manufacturer’s set of drawings.

(4) If there is no manufacturer or shipbuilder listed, the drawing will go in the first drawer
and sorted by drawing number.

(5) A drawing may have several different company names and their drawing numbers listed
on it: Ship designer, shipbuilder, manufacturer of the item or component. Always use the name

of the manufacturer of the item and drawing is prepared for, or applies to.

(6) _ Ifa drawing has a shipbuilder’s name and number, as well as a manufacturer’s name and
drawing number, the manufacturer’s name and number will be used for sorting.

24
(7) Check carefully for duplicate copies of the drawings. Ensure they are exactly the same,
including the title, drawing number, revision, alteration or sheet numbers. If all of the data on
the drawings are identical, the drawings are duplicate copies.

Caution: If the title, drawing number, revision, alteration or sheet numbers are not exactly the
same, the drawings are not duplicate copies. |

(8) Certification Data Sheets are normally attached to the drawing they are certifying.

available, they will be written up separately.

(b) If the certifying drawing is available, the certification data sheet will be attached
to it.

(c) The attachment is referenced in that drawing’s Full Description field.

(1) The following information will be entered into the Full Description field
of the certified drawing: WITH ATTACHED CD’s. |

(2) The abbreviations CDs, for Certification Data Sheet, FEDS for Fan
Certification Data Sheet; and DWG, for drawing, are authorized for use in the
drawing Full Description field.

(10) A drawing may be made up of several sheets. The Sheet number is listed at the bottom of |
the drawing, and is usually found in a block labeled “Sheet”, “sht’, “page”, or “pg”. Sometimes,
it is shown in the drawing number field.

Example: #2468 1/3 ” the 1/3” indicates “Sheet 1 of 3 sheets”
There are three possible ways to inventory these drawings.

(a) If the sheets have the same title and drawing number, inventory using one
drawing inventory add sheet, and following the description, write in “sheets X thru X”.
Fold- and store these sheets together. They will be sorted by the manufacturer and
manufacturers drawing number.

(b) If the drawing is made up of several sheets with different titles and the same
drawing inventory add sheets, Following the description, write the number of the sheet
being inventoried and the total number of sheets contained in the drawings:

Example: “Sheet 3 of 6”.

(c) If all of the sheets are fastened together in a booklet, pertain to the same system or
equipment, inventory them as a booklet:

Example: “Booklet, Sheets X thru XX” or “Booklet, Sheets X through
XX, XX, XX and XX thru XX”.

(11) Multiple drawings sets. Are those with several d rawings attached together with each
drawing having their own unique manufacturer or drawing numbers. In this case, each drawing
must be written up separately and the drawings cross referenced to each other.

25
(a). Drawings are cross referenced in their Full Description field.

(b) The following example provides information on how to cross reference drawings:
a General Electric drawing, #123B1234, which has an RCA drawing, #456789, and
Square D drawing, #321C4321, attached. The following information will be entered in
the TITLE field for each drawing after that drawings title. :

(1) F or the General Elec

tri
RCA, #456789, Al RE

drawing, #123B1234: “WITH ATTACHED
ND SQUARE D, #321C4321”.

(2) For the RCA, #456789, and Square D, #321C43221 drawings:
“ATTACHED TO GENERAL ELECTRIC, #123B1234”,

(3) The RCA, #456789 and Square D, #321C4321, drawings will have the
same location, file cabinet, and drawer as listed for the General Electric,
#123B1234, drawing. Without this location information, the attached drawings
may never be located.

(4)  An“A” is placed in the upper right hand corner of the drawing inventory
add sheets for the RCA, #456789 and Square D, #321C43221, drawings to
indicate that the drawing is attached to another di awing for data entry purp
This is done ONLY for the attached drawings.

c. Inventory Procedures. Once sorting is complete, the inventory can be started.

(1) On ships with a drawing data base, a printed drawing inventory aid will be provided for
each drawing storage location to conduct the inventory. The drawing inventory aids will be
printed in the drawing location, manufacturer, drawing number and revision or alteration
sequence.

(2) On ships without a drawing database, the drawings must be inventoried and written up on
the drawing inventory add sheets. |

(3) Locate the drawing inventory aids and verify all printed information, correct and/or add
information as necessary. If there are drawings that are not listed, use the drawing inventory add
sheets to write up the drawings.

(4) When a field has no information available, place a tick in the field to indicate the
information was reviewed and not available. |

(5) All drawings attached to another drawing, or as part of a drawing set, must be inventoried
and cross referenced in the Full Description field of the drawing they are attached to, and in the
Full Description field for the attached drawing. There must be a record established for the
attached drawing, even if the attached drawing is the only one available.

(6) When there are duplicate copies of a drawing and a copy is attached to other drawings, or
drawing sets, the following must be followed.

(a) The Full Description field for the duplicate drawing will contain the following
statements: “ONE ATTACHED TO General Electric, #123A 7654”.

26
(b) If there are several duplicate copies of a drawing attached to several other
drawings, each attachment must be indicated in the Full Description field of the attached
drawing and in the Full Description field of the duplicate drawing. If all attachment
information will not fit into the Full Description field of the duplicate record, an
additional record must be established and the additional attachment information entered
into its Full Description field.

(7) After a drawing is inventoried or written up, place a small colored dot on the drawing to

indicate that it has been completed. This will preclude additional work if the drawing is removed

(8) | When a cabinet drawer, or box, is completely inventoried, place a small colored dot on
the cabinet drawer or box to indicate that it is complete.

5. Ship Drawing Inventory Add Sheets: The following information is provided to assist inventory
personnel to correctly mark up drawing inventory aids, or to fill out the drawing inventory add sheet. The
drawing inventory add sheet used during an inventory will be numbered sequentially to track the drawing
until it is entered in the data base and assigned a record ID. See Appendix B Form 14.

Drawing Title field. Record the title exactly as it is in the title block of the drawing.
Record the information for any certification data sheets, sheet number or drawings attachment.

MARAD Number field. Record the MARAD number and any revision or alteration number
or letter. A careful search of the drawing must be made because the MARAD number may be place
in various locations on the drawing. a | |

C. .NUFACTURER’S Name field. The manufacturer is the company
that the drawing information pertains to for equipment description or installation. The

-manufacturer’s name is normally found in the drawing title block.

PBUILDER or MA

CAUTION: Extreme care must be taken when determining the manufacturer because the drawing
may include aname and drawing number for the ships designer, the ship builder, the manufacturer
of the equipment or material installation the drawing,

The drawing manufacturer is always the manufacturer of the equipment or material installation. If
the drawing is a shipbuilder’s drawing, record the shipbuilder’s name in the manufacturer’s field.

d. SHIPBUILDER or MANUFACTURER’S Drawing Number field. Record the drawing

_ number which is normally found in the drawing title block. Often, the drawing number is preceded

__ by other data in a separate field preceding the drawing number field. DO NOT include this data as
part of the drawing number.

(1) Record the drawing number as written on the drawing. If there are spaces between
numbers or letters, leave a space, if there are dashes or slashes, record them.

(2) If there is no manufacturer’s drawing number to use, write NOT LISTED in the
drawing number field,

(3) If the drawing is one sheet of several sheets; record the sheet number as: SHT X of
A, as listed on the drawing. Record the sheet number in the manufacturer’s drawing number
field and in the Drawing Title field.

APPENDIX I

ARTS INVENTORY

l. The Ships Spare Parts. A ships spare parts provides the crew with material to repair the ships installed
machinery. The spare parts include Bulkhead Mounted Spares and Loose Spare Parts.

a.

The ships spare parts are inventoried to correct ly identify them, their on board_quantityand-t
and equipment assignment using the on board technical manual.

(1) They are inventoried as part of a ships logistics overhaul, logistics upgrade, or as a
separate task.

(2) Their inventory should be conducted after the technical manual and ships drawing
inventories, and the equipment validation to provide correct technical documentation for
use during the inventory process and valid equipment for assignment of the Spare Parts.

The Spare Parts are usually stored in storerooms, on shelves and in Spare Part Boxes. Currently,
there is an effort to convert an existing spare to a Vidmar Cabinet Storeroom. The Spare Parts are
relocated into the drawers of the Vidmar Cabinets during the inventory process, if they are installed.

The final storage location for the Spare Parts is normally established during the Pre-Survey of the
ship or during the Initial Task Meeting on the ship. The Logistics Contractor will follow the
requirements in the task statement of work (SOW) and the direction for storage provided by the
Region LMO and CE. |

During the inventory process, spare parts locations such as Vidmar Cabinets and drawers are name
and bar code labeled.

The ships NS5 Spare Parts Data Base is updated with the inventory results. The Process used for the
NS5 updating is discussed in Section 2, Spare Part Data Entry.

The Bulkhead Mounted Spares (BKMS). These spares will be the first spare parts to be inventoried
in order to get metal tags prepared by Prolog Vitginia Beach office for application prior to
completion of the Overhaul.

2. Spare Part Inventory Procedures. These Spare Parts Inventory Procedures provide a clear, logical
process to complete the spare part and bulkhead mounted spares inventory. A thorough understanding of the
process is required to perform an accurate inventory. When in doubt about a procedure, ask for clarification.
_ Do not guess about what is required. Time will be saved if the first inventory write-up is correct.

3. Spare Part Inventory Sheets. There are two individual Spare Part Inventory Sheets used to conduct
the inventory. Both contain data fields for all required information.

a.

The inventory Aid Sheets are printed in spare part description sequence using the current
information from the parts data base in NSS.

(1) They are printed on blue paper and are comn
Inventory Aid.

ionly referred to as “Blue sheets” or

29
(2) They are printed for each current storage location to conduct the inventory.
(3) They are printed in location, box, and shelf sequence.

(4) All items in the data base without an on-hand quantity will have a ‘O”’ printed in the
Inv/Qty field to limit Technical Manual reference time.

b. The Spare Part Inventory Add Sheet is printed on white paper, and contains all the required fields for
recording data to add spare parts to the inventory.

a. Inventory Packages. The inventory Aid Sheets are grouped into Inventory Packages by Spare Part
Box(s), or location when the spare parts and bulkhead mounted spares are not stored in a Spare Part Box.

a. The Inventory process flow. The Inventory Packages are identified by the box number or location
name. An Inventory Package Cover Sheet is prepared by the Inventory Team Leader and the
Inventory Aid Sheets are attached.

b. Several spare part boxes or locations may be combined into a large Inventory Package. The
Inventory Package Cover Sheet for this combined package will list the individual Spare Part Boxes
or locations.

c. The Inventory Packages are tracked through the process by the Inventory Team Leader using the
Inventory Package tracking sheet.

d. The Inventory Team Leader will stamp a sequential number on multiple Spare Part Inventory add
sheets for use by the Inventory Team to add spare parts to the inventory.

5. The Inventory Process. The Inventory Team will follow these procedures. This will identify the
inventory process for Spare Parts. They apply whether inventorying a spare part box, a separate location or
Bulkhead Mounted Spares.

a. The following describes the inventory process and provides information accumulated over the years
to improve the process. Specific and detailed guidance is provided in paragraph 6 where the
Inventory Aid Sheet and Spare Part Inventory Add Sheet data fields are discussed.

(1) The Inventory Packages are assigned by the Inventory Team Leader based on the
expertise of the Inventory Team Members. He will prepare the Inventory Package
Tracking Sheet as the Inventory Packages are assigned.

(2) The Inventory Technician should keep the assigned Inventory Package and Spare Parts
Inventory Add Sheets in a 12” x 12” zip-lock bag to help keep them clean. Do not bend,
fold, or roll the Inventory Package or the Spare Part Inventory Add Sheets.

(3) Upon assignment of an Inventory Package, locate and sign out the technical manual for
the spare parts being inventoried. |

(a) Use the equipment name and number from the Inventory Aid Sheets to determin
the correct Technical Manual.

(b). The spare parts are researched to obtain the correct Technical Reference Data,
equipment assignment, verify previously collected data on the Inventory Aid
Sheet and to record data on the Spare Parts Inventory Add Sheets.

(c). Return and sign in the Technical Manual upon completion of your research. The
Technical Manuals will be used by other Inventory Team Members during their
inventory work.

(d). Ships drawings may provide information for material when no Technical Manual
is available. However, they are not normally taken to the inventory site.

Take your Inventory Tool Kit, Inventory Supplies and Inventory Procedures to the

inventory site

(a) The Inventory Tool Kit should include clear tape, pencils, erasers, knife, masking
tape and flashlight.

(b) Inventory supplies includes each type of inventory labels, blank spare part labels,
small labels, electrical cable ties, Tyvek shipping tags, an assortment of the
various size zip-lock bags and a trash bag.

Proceed to the location identified on the Inventory Package; identify the Spare Parts Box
which you are to inventory.

If need be move the Spare Part Box to a convenient location for the inventory. Do not

block the walkway around your work area with the Spare Parts Box, spare parts or trash.

Remove all material from the Spare Part Box.
(a). Place all trash in a trash bag

(b) Group all identical items prior to starting your inventory. If there are identical
spare parts with different names or descriptions, determine the correct name using the
Technical Manual and the One Word Noun Name Rule, then combine these identical
parts into one zip-lock bag.

NOTE: The One Word Noun Name Rule is that all spare parts will be identified using a
one word noun as the spare part name, which is then followed by the descriptive data for
the spare part. Additional information is provided in paragraph 6.b. (5).

(c) Some identical spare parts support different equipment, and have different
equipment numbers. Do Not combine these spare parts because they will have separate
records in NS5. Each will be inventoried separately and assigned to the equipment they
support.

(d) Do not consolidate spare parts with different part numbers.

(c) Do not consolidate spare parts with different manufacturers. This applies to
bearing when the same bearing number is found but from different manufacturers.

The Spare Part Box or location often contains consumables. They are removed and
stowed in the location designated by the CE or MARAD Logistics representative.

31
(9)

(a) If consumables are to remain in the location, they must be placed in a zip-lock bag .
and labeled or if they are too large to be bagged, attach a Tyvek Tag to them. The
Label/Tag will read as follows NOT INVENTORIED.

(b) If in doubt about whether the material should be inventoried, ask your Inventory
Team leader. The final determination of whether these items are inventory
worthy is always made by the MARAD Representative.

When a Spare part is determined to be Excess be

inventory; place them in a zip-lock bag, apply an EXCESS label and place them in the
designated EXCESS location, and enter EXCESS by the lines in the Inventory Package.

(a). The Chief Engineer will review all EXCESS Spare part for application to other on
board equipment.

(b). He will provide the equipment name and he wants the EXCESS spare parts
assigned to for retention.

When there are identical new and used parts, place the used parts inside their own zip-
lock bag and put a “USED” label on the bag and move the part to the designated location |

for used parts. Do up an Add Sheet for the used parts ensuring that the part description
includes USED.

The USED label allows the CE / MARAD Re presentative to quickly decide whether to

keep the USED part in the inventory.

(a) If the CE / MARAD Representative circles the Keep portion of the USED label,

retain the spare parts in the Inventory. Leave the USED label on the zip-lock bag.

(b) If the CE / MARAD Representative circles the TOSS portion of the USED label,
the inventory Team Member must remove the spare parts from the inventory,
apply a SCRAP label to the spare parts and place them in the designated SCRAP
location, and correct the Inventory Aid Sheet.

The USED label is also applied to spare parts which are determined to be unserviceable /
unusable because of broken or missing components. The MARAD representative will
make his determination and the spare parts processed as in Section 2, paragraph 11a and

1b.

When a spare part cannot be identified by the Inventory Team Member, it will be labeled
with an UNIDENTIFIED label, |

(a) Complete as much of an Inventory Spare Part Add Sheet as possible, and make
sure your name and the spare part’s original location is written in.

(b) Put the Inventory Spare Part Add Sheet and the spare part in a zip-lock bag.
Apply the UNIDENTIFIED label to the zip-lock bag, place the item in the
location designated for UNIDENTIFIED parts, and advise the Inventory Team
Leader.

(b). The preservation may include cleaning of bare surface and spraying with a
protective coating, wrapping in cosmoline paper / bubble wrap, or covering with
flexible plastic tubing. As a general rule machinery parts should be wrapped in
cosmoline paper or preservation spray used, while electrical parts should be
wrapped in bubble wrap, however judgment will apply.

(c). Any previously applied preservation method, or existing packaging in good
condition, can be repaired and reused.

(a) Unless the old zip-lock bag is in very good condition, use a new zip-lock bag.

(b) Use the correct size of zip-lock bag. Do not over fill the zip-lock bag. The spare
parts shall be easily removed and replaced. Do not use a zip-lock bag larger than
required.

(c) Place the spare part in the zip-lock bag so the manufacturers data and part number
can be read without removing the spare part from the zip-lock bag. This will
assist in locating the spare parts for usage and during the QA process.

(d) = If several zip-lock bags are required to stow a large number of spare parts, do not
tape these zip-lock bags together.

If the spare part will not fit into a zip-lock bag, attach a Tyvek tag for labeling.

Ifa Tyvek tag can not be attached, make a circle around a portion of the spare part with
masking tape or cable ties, and attach the Tyvek tag to it.

After all possible spare parts are matched to the Inventory Aid Sheets and are
inventoried, the remaining spare parts are to be inventoried using the Spare Part
Inventory Add Sheets.

(a) Included all available information on the Spare Part Inventory Add Sheet. A full
description is required.

(b) Provide sufficient descriptive data to allow positive identification, and to
distinguish between similar, yet different items.

During the bar code labeling, Do Not put a Spare part label directly on a spare part.

(a) If a zip-lock bag is used, place the spare part label on the outside of the zip-lock
bag and tape over the label with clear plastic tape.

(b)  Donotplacea Spare part label on the inside a zip-lock bag

(c) If a Tyvek Shipping tag was attached, apply the spare part label on it, and tape
over the spare part label with plastic tape.

(d) If the spare part is covered with the flexible plastic tubing, put the bar code label
on a zip-lock bag, cover it with clear plastic tape, then tape the zip-lock bag to the
flexible tubing. Do not cover any technical information on the Spare part.

34
man-hours because of the new inventory persons must review the current status of
all spare parts.

(27). Inventory Data Entry. The information from the Inventory Aid and Add sheets are
entered into NS5 by the Data Entry Technician.

6. Inventory Sheet Fields. The data fields on the Inventory Aid Sheet and the Spare Part Inventory
Add Sheet are used to record all available data for the Ships Spare Parts and Bulkhead Mounted Spares.

a. Guidelines. The _below_guidelines are-provided-to assist in correct recording of the inventory
data. Some of the information ay be repeated here that was found in paragraph 5 because of its
importance. Additional guidance is provided for recording data when each field is discussed in
paragraph 6.b below.

(1) The data must be recorded so that the QA, and Data Entry Technician can correctly _
understand what you have recorded.

(2) When the information for a field has been researched and no information found, place a
single dash (-) in the field to show that information was researched but not found.

(a) Do not place “NONE”, “NA”, or any other information except the single dash in
the field when the required information is not available.

(b) If any field is left blank, it is assumed that the field was overlooked.

(3) All entries on the Inventory Aid Sheet and the Spare Part Inventory Add Sheets will be
made in pencil to facilitate corrections.

(4) Use capital letters when recording data on the Inventory Aid sheet or the Spare Part
Inventory Add Sheets. See Appendix B for the proper formation of letters and numbers.

(5) Print neatly, legibly and clearly.

(6) Use proper spacing between words and letters.

(7) Use proper punctuation between data elements in a field.

(3) The following punctuation marks cannot be used on the Inventory Aid Sheet, the Spare
Part Inventory Add Sheet or during data entry: An ampersand (&), pound symbol (#), a
semicolon (;), or parentheses 0.

(9) DO NOT use abbreviations except those that are provided for you in Appendix C, D, and
E.

(10) You may need to add amplifying information for a Spare part to further explain
something. You can make a note in the margin, or on the back, of the Inventory Aid Sheet or the
Spare Part Inventory Add Sheets. When information is placed on the back of the sheets, write
“OVER” on the bottom of the front side of the Inventory Aid Sheet or the Spare Part Inventory

Add Sheet to indicate the location of the additional information to the QA and Data Entry
Technician. |

36
compare this report against his inventory sheets prior to the Logistics Support Manager
ordering the BMS tags. |

(4) The DESCRIPTION field. The DESCRIPTION field is used to describe the spare part
as listed in the Technical Manual. The One Word Noun Name Rule is applied in this field.

(a) The DESCRIPTION field is divided into two separate data elements by a comma.
The first data element contains the nomenclature or name of the spare part, the second data element contains
all available descriptive data for the spare part.

— (b) The Word Noun Name Rule is applied to the first data element. It required
the spare part to be described with a one word noun for its name.

Example: Roller Bearing = Bearing, Roller

(1) The only exceptions to this rule are those spare parts which require
multiple noun words to correctly name them or where the one word name would
not make logical sense.

Example: Circuit Breaker; Grid Member; Valve and Gauge Assembly; Brake Repair
Kit; Seal Assembly; Salinity Module; Contact Set.

(2) Do not use plurals names unless it makes common sense such as lens,
pliers, or bellows.

(c) The primary sources of information for the spare part is from the Technical
Manual, and on the spare part. The Spare part packaging may provide useful data but it is
questionable unless completely intact.

(d). ‘If the spare part packaging is completely intact and appears to be factory sealed,
the abbreviations FS will be place in the DESCRIPTION field, and the packaging will
not be opened.

(1) The abbreviation FS will not be entered in the description field of the
Spare part record in NS5 by the Data Entry Technician.

(2) If all available technical sources have been used to obtain data and the
Inventory Team Leader determines there is not sufficient descriptive data to
identify the spare part, he will decide if the Spare part should be opened to obtain
the information. |

(3) However, if opening the spare part could make it unusable, it should not —

be opened without the permission of the CE / MARAD Representative.

(f) Underline any data in the DESCRIPTION field that may be important for
identification and should be considered for retention in the database. Disposition of the
underlined data will be the responsibility of the Inventory Team Leader.

(g) Mark through incorrect data and record the correct data.

(h) Use the following guide to sequence descriptive data.

38
(6) You must provide a direct path to the spare part in the Technical
Manual.

(c) The pages in the technical manual where the Spare part is listed
will be marked with Post-It notes with the Spare part’s part number written
on it to assist in the QA process.

There are five major types of g

DUPLEX — TWO INDICATING NEEDLES, which measure different
oarameters on the same gauge. a

2. COMPOUND — measures a range of vacuum (HG) to pressure (PSIG).

TIAL PRESSURE — measures the pressure difference between two

in units PSID (pounds per square inch differential).

Mi — measures vacuum only in units HG (inches of mercury).

RE — measures pressure only in units PSIG (pounds per square inch gauge).
