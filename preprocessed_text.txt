These spares will be the first spare parts to be inventoried in order to get metal tags prepared by Prolog virginia Beach office for application prior to completion of the overhaul 2. Spare Part Inventory procedures These Spare Parts Inventory Procedures provide a clear logical process to complete the spare part and bulkhead mounted spares inventory A thorough understanding of the process is required to perform an accurate inventory When in doubt about a procedure ask for clarification _ Do not guess about what is required Time will be saved if the first inventory writeup is correct 3. Spare Part Inventory sheets There are two individual Spare Part Inventory Sheets used to conduct the inventory Both contain data fields for all required information a The inventory Aid Sheets are printed in spare part description sequence using the current information from the parts data base in nss (1) They are printed on blue paper and are come Inventory aid only referred to as blue sheets or 29 (2) They are printed for each current storage location to conduct the inventory (3) They are printed in location box and shelf sequence (4) All items in the data base without an unhand quantity will have a ‘O”’ printed in the Inv/Qty field to limit Technical Manual reference time be The Spare Part Inventory Add Sheet is printed on white paper and contains all the required fields for recording data to add spare parts to the inventory a Inventory packages The inventory Aid Sheets are grouped into Inventory Packages by Spare Part Box(s), or location when the spare parts and bulkhead mounted spares are not stored in a Spare Part box a The Inventory process flow The Inventory Packages are identified by the box number or location name An Inventory Package Cover Sheet is prepared by the Inventory Team Leader and the Inventory Aid Sheets are attached be Several spare part boxes or locations may be combined into a large Inventory package The Inventory Package Cover Sheet for this combined package will list the individual Spare Part Boxes or locations ca The Inventory Packages are tracked through the process by the Inventory Team Leader using the Inventory Package tracking sheet do The Inventory Team Leader will stamp a sequential number on multiple Spare Part Inventory add sheets for use by the Inventory Team to add spare parts to the inventory 5. The Inventory process The Inventory Team will follow these procedures This will identify the inventory process for Spare parts They apply whether inventorying a spare part box a separate location or Bulkhead mounted spares a The following describes the inventory process and provides information accumulated over the years to improve the process Specific and detailed guidance is provided in paragraph 6 where the Inventory Aid Sheet and Spare Part Inventory Add Sheet data fields are discussed (1) The Inventory Packages are assigned by the Inventory Team Leader based on the expertise of the Inventory Team members He will prepare the Inventory Package Tracking Sheet as the Inventory Packages are assigned (2) The Inventory Technician should keep the assigned Inventory Package and Spare Parts Inventory Add Sheets in a 12” x 12” ziploc bag to help keep them clean Do not bend fold or roll the Inventory Package or the Spare Part Inventory Add sheets (3) Upon assignment of an Inventory package locate and sign out the technical manual for the spare parts being inventoried | a Use the equipment name and number from the Inventory Aid Sheets to determine the correct Technical manual (b). The spare parts are researched to obtain the correct Technical Reference data equipment assignment verify previously collected data on the Inventory Aid Sheet and to record data on the Spare Parts Inventory Add sheets 30 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (c). Return and sign in the Technical Manual upon completion of your research The Technical Manuals will be used by other Inventory Team Members during their inventory work (d). Ships drawings may provide information for material when no Technical Manual is available however they are not normally taken to the inventory either Take your Inventory Tool kit Inventory Supplies and Inventory Procedures to the inventory site a The Inventory Tool Kit should include clear tape pencils erasers knife masking tape and flashlight be Inventory supplies includes each type of inventory labels blank spare part labels small labels electrical cable ties type shipping tags an assortment of the various size ziploc bags and a trash bag Proceed to the location identified on the Inventory package identify the Spare Parts Box which you are to inventory If need be move the Spare Part Box to a convenient location for the inventory Do not block the walkway around your work area with the Spare Parts box spare parts or trash Remove all material from the Spare Part box (a). Place all trash in a trash bag be Group all identical items prior to starting your inventory If there are identical spare parts with different names or descriptions determine the correct name using the Technical Manual and the One Word Noun Name rule then combine these identical parts into one ziploc bag note The One Word Noun Name Rule is that all spare parts will be identified using a one word noun as the spare part name which is then followed by the descriptive data for the spare part Additional information is provided in paragraph 6.b. (5). act Some identical spare parts support different equipment and have different equipment numbers Do Not combine these spare parts because they will have separate records in nss Each will be inventoried separately and assigned to the equipment they support do Do not consolidate spare parts with different part numbers act Do not consolidate spare parts with different manufacturers This applies to bearing when the same bearing number is found but from different manufacturers The Spare Part Box or location often contains consumables They are removed and stowed in the location designated by the CE or MARAD Logistics representative 31 (9) a If consumables are to remain in the location they must be placed in a ziploc bag . and labeled or if they are too large to be bagged attach a type Tag to them The Label/Tag will read as follows NOT inventoried be If in doubt about whether the material should be inventoried ask your Inventory Team leader The final determination of whether these items are inventory worthy is always made by the MARAD representative When a Spare part is determined to be Excess be use the equipment it supports has been removed from the ship the Invent be will remove the enarenarthe fran che team member mev spar from (10).
